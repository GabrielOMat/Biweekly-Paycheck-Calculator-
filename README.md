# Biweekly-Paycheck-Calculator-
Created a Java program that asked the use to input their payrate and hours works. Once the use has input the needed info it calculates the over time worked and how much is gonna be payed for those over time hours. In the end it outputs the paycheck which includes over time pay and regular pay, but excludes taxes being taken out.
